Hangman

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. In my version of hangman, the player has 6 attempts to guess the correct letter of the word. After 6 incorrect guesses a stick man is fully formed on the hanging frame and so the game ends and the player loses.
The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.

Features
The features of the game are; 
- ASCII characters that form the stick man which correspond to the correct and incorrect guesses of the player. 
- Hyphens to indicate the missing letters of each word. 

Features Left to Implement
- A feature idea that can be implemented to this game is levels of difficulty. After a player successfully guesses a round of words, he could move to the next round with loner and more complex words
- Another feature would be that I could add are hints for the players that would provide the meaning of the word or a synonym. 
- An additional feature would be a multi-player option where multiple players could compete against one another. The fastest person to guess their word wins.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
